Space Age The Wall MK1 Dev


gLOBAL TODO:


	include landfill in construction train
	
	make the on ramp to rail be able to have at least 2 trains waiting and not block the main rail?? probably not
	
	make blue prints for reloading the the construction train
	
	use negative signals to rigger the train to go back to station if any item is completly used
	
	make station have soem sort of trigger or switch so its not enabled while being built, have the station start without the minimums constasn combinator active
	
	?? dont have restrictions on the rain cargo but use circuits to only load 1 stack of each item then there would be enough room to relaod back onto the train....
	
	
TODO:

Make white light logic depend on all rail signals, any red or yellow signal
Lights on the side of the rails that light up when train is in the chunck, uses timer? 0 <- 1 <- 2 -> 1 -> 0 based on tain location?
Gates also trigger light ?	
Finalize values for all timers

BLUE PRINT Train Depot:

	Radar is enabled based on global Accumalter charge 

	load cars with smart loader cirtucuits so there is no need for cargo filter

	unload all extra "non requested items"

	reload train with fuel and wait until it is full before green signal

	X pulsed on green global wire will clear all requests

TODO:

	the oil pumps are backwards, in some spots

	collection all not requested items from storage and send them out of logistics via a belt

	Is a sepearate logistics with its own bots and everything is requested
